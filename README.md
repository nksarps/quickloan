# QuickLoan Mobile Ethical Data Review Lab

**Author**: *Nana Kwaku Sarpong*

## Overview

This lab project evaluates the data governance, quality, and ethical risks in QuickLoan Mobile’s loan application pipeline. QuickLoan Mobile is a Ghanaian fintech startup that provides instant micro-loans via a mobile app. The company’s fully automated machine learning (ML) loan-scoring system raised concerns regarding data collection practices, legal compliance, and algorithmic fairness.  

As part of this lab, an independent governance review was conducted to identify risks, propose practical mitigations, and recommend an ethical reporting metric to monitor automated decision-making.


## Deliverables

The project consists of three main deliverables, each addressing key aspects of the review:

1. **Governance Review Card**  
   - A concise table highlighting **data quality risks**, **legal & compliance risks**, **bias & fairness risks**, and a **recommended ethical reporting metric**.  
   - [View Governance Review Card](governance_review_card.md)

2. **Corrected Data Flow Diagram**  
   - A revised diagram of QuickLoan’s data pipeline with **annotated corrections** for excessive collection, lack of consent, missing classification/retention, preprocessing gaps, and decision logging.  
   - [View Corrected Data Flow Diagram](corrected_data_flow_diagram.md)

3. **Summary of Review Process**  
   - A 200–300 word summary explaining how **Data Lifecycle and Classification principles** were applied to identify risks and how the proposed metric ensures ethical and transparent governance.

This lab provides a complete, real-world example of ethical data governance in fintech and can serve as a template for similar ML-powered applications.
